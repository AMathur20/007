This is a working Goldeneye 007 disassembly!


All code is disassembled!
Known functions are labeled. Addresses in .data have not been symbolically represented yet.

All of 21990 compressed data segment is decompressed and assigned to .data.
I think all strings are now represented by .asciiz statements.
Alot of labels made. Still have to do formatting and structuring of data.

Started Makefile and linker scripts.

KNOWN BUGS:
NONE!!!!


Also, still need to take the big series of includes making a single object, and split to many objects linked to right spot. Deconstruction of individual files in ob_seg will happened during or as a result of this.


This dissassembly was made possible by a ton of people who will all be listed later when I make a proper readme.
